    ---original from greteSa@email.com---
    Mr. Bezos, 
    Due to unforeseen, inexplicable circumstances, Gregor was unable to make it to work this morning. This is going to sound absurd, but bear with me. He woke up transformed into a large cockroach. He has been acclimating to new form and has been slowly regaining his ability to type.
    
    Best, 
    Grete`,
