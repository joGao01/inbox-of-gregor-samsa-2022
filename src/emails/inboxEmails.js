    Unfortunately, your performance in the past two weeks has been subpar. While you retain the ability to write and compose emails, I've received multiple complaints regarding your inability to communicate in person. Given the progression of your condition, it would be best if you took time off. 
  
    Should your ailment show signs of easing up, you will be allowed to return to work.
