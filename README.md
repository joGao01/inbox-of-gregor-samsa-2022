# Inbox of Gregor Samsa (2022)

This is a remake of a project I originally did in 2019 for an art class.

It all started because I was looking over my GitHub stuff, getting ready to apply to [insert some big tech company here]. And I realized, "Yikes! The README for this project is still in unformatted plaintext!" (Bro, 2019 was a dark time. I had just learned Javascript in my art class. I had never heard of markdown.)

So I went into the repo and quickly fixed that. Phew, crisis averted. The fact that I wouldn't perceive markdown until my senior year in college would henceforth be between me and God\*.

However, in the process of doing this, I accidentally uncovered something that I had long forgotten about: the horrors of my early Javascript code. It's hard to articulate all the things that were wrong with it, so I'm just going to leave this screenshot here:

[Insert a pic once i push all of this to github]

Yea.

I wanted to fix this. I really did. But there is no salvation for a 1000+ line long javascript file that uses `innerHTML` with such reckless abandon.

Is using Svelte a little overkill? Maybe. But using Svelte definitely made this easier, and I'm a big fan of doing things the easy way.
